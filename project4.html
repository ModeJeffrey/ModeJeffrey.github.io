        <h2>Eagle Scout Project</h2>
        <p>I was in the Boy Scouts of America for twelve years during my youth, eventually culminating in reaching the rank of Eagle Scout, the highest rank the Scouts has to offer. One of the most important things I had to do to reach this rank was my Eagle Project, where I chose to design and paint a mural representing the values of my high school. This project is a good example of my design skills and proficiency working with a team.</p>
        <p>The first thing that I did for the mural was come up with a design. I went through many different iterations, but the one I eventually settled on was a sun-like design in the school colors with rays shooting out of it, with the values of the school written inside the rays.</p>

        <p>The next step I had to take was to get the mural staging board ready. Working with the principal of my school and my art teacher, we found a suitable wall to paint the mural on and began to sketch the outline of the design onto it.</p>

        <p>After the sketch was complete, I got to work on the painting of the mural. Using students from my school as volunteers, I helped direct several teams in filling the mural with color. It was a rather difficult task to direct these different teams all at once, but with my leadership skills I learned in the Scouts, I managed to make it work.</p>

        <p>After the painting was done, this is the finished result - It continues to adorn the walls of my high school as a reminder of the institution's values and of my creative intellect.</p>
